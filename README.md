*"Every time you place a stone on the board, you are exposing something of yourself."*
— Takeo Kajiwara

You've found something.

## The Board

A lone stone appears as a scout—watchful, vulnerable. Place another beside it: they recognize each other, become a patrol. Add more and a banner rises. The pieces don't just occupy intersections. They remember. They grow in the presence of allies. They face enemies together.

Territory transforms as you play. Scorched earth where attackers advance. Cultivated fields where defenders hold ground. When a group falls, stones don't simply disappear—they crumble. The board absorbs them. The game continues.

This is not simulation. This is how the board has always worked. You've just never seen it before.

Ancient game. Ancient magic. Minimal. Tasteful. Real.

## The Vibe

Stones evolve: scout → patrol → war band → battalion → legion with siege engines.

Territory responds: farmland vs scorched earth. Camps become keeps. Keeps become citadels.

Simple rules. Deep presence. Every move reshapes what was and what becomes.

## The Philosophy

Simple. Robust. Concise. Clean. Decoupled.

Every line earns its place. No abstractions for abstraction's sake. The backend knows the rules. The frontend knows how things look. Neither knows about the other. That's how it should be.

## Tech Stack

- **Rust backend** - Because game rules should be bulletproof
- **Svelte frontend** - Because UIs should disappear
- **SVG + themes** - Because your stones deserve better than circles
- **WebSocket** - Because waiting is for chumps

Zero runtime dependencies. One binary. No database. No bullshit.

## Getting Started

See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for the boring details.

## Current Status
MVP in progress. Core game logic and visual themes coming soon.
