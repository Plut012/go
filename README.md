# Go

*"Every time you place a stone on the board, you are exposing something of yourself."*
— Takeo Kajiwara

This is not a normal Go board...

## What Is This?

A web-based Go game that makes placing stones feel like commanding armies in a fantasy war. Think hologram chess from Star Wars, but it's Go, and the pieces evolve as your groups grow stronger.

Play from your phone. Play from your laptop. Play from anywhere. 

## The Vibe

Welcome to **Grim Toon** Go: where Warhammer's brooding darkness meets Clash Royale's chunky charm. Stones don't just sit there—they *live*.

## The Philosophy

Simple. Robust. Concise. Clean. Decoupled.

Every line earns its place. No abstractions for abstraction's sake. The backend knows the rules. The frontend knows how things look. Neither knows about the other. That's how it should be.

## Tech Stack

- **Rust backend** - Because game rules should be bulletproof
- **Svelte frontend** - Because UIs should disappear
- **SVG + themes** - Because your stones deserve better than circles
- **WebSocket** - Because waiting is for chumps

Zero runtime dependencies. One binary. No database. No bullshit.

## Getting Started

See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for the boring details.

## Current Status
MVP in progress. Core game logic and visual themes coming soon.
