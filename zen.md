# The Direction of Play: Kajiwara's Philosophy

*A meditation on stones, direction, and the spirit of Go*

## About the Book

**The Direction of Play** by Takeo Kajiwara (9-dan) is a lucid exposition of the basic principles of direction in Go—understanding the direction in which a stone or group of stones exerts its main influence.

Kajiwara was born in 1923 in Niigata Prefecture, Japan, and promoted to 9-dan in 1965. His novel go style with its famous "drilling tactics" is highly esteemed.

## The Philosophy of Direction

### The Power of Stones

Kajiwara emphasizes that each stone carries intrinsic power and responsibility:

> "Each stone, whether it stands alone or with others, is invested with a power all its own."

Every stone has a **life of its own** and expresses the individuality of the player. Understanding how stones relate to and support each other is fundamental to advancement in Go.

### The Existential Act of Placement

Each move is a deeply personal act:

> "Every time you place a stone on the board, you are exposing something of yourself...your feelings, your individuality, your will power, and once it is played there is no going back."

This is not merely strategy—it is a reflection of character and spirit. Go transcends tactical calculation and becomes a mirror of who we are.

### Wholeness and Relationship

The key to powerful play is understanding the **relationship between each stone and the overall position**. Only then can we realize the full potential of every stone we play.

Direction of play concerns proper stone placement throughout:
- The opening (fuseki)
- The middle game
- Fighting phases

This principle, while conceptually simple, proves difficult to execute consistently.

## The Zen Connection

### Presence and Flow

The practice of Zen is central to Go. It enhances our **flow of awareness** and deflates the ego's ambitions by dissolving the barrier between path and goal.

We do not play to reach some future state of victory—we **engage the present moment as fully as we can**.

### Emptiness Over Accumulation

The ancient culture from which Go emerged was steeped in Taoist, Confucian, and Zen Buddhist traditions. In the Eastern model, and Zen specifically, wisdom comes not from **filling our heads with facts and figures**, but only after **emptying** them.

Like a cup that must be empty to be filled, the mind must be clear to see the board's truth.

### Humility and Patience

Zen teaches us to cultivate **patience**—but just as importantly, **humility**.

The ego seeks victory. The spirit seeks understanding. Each stone teaches us to let go of attachment to outcome and focus on the purity of each decision.

### The Paradox of Mastery

This mirrors martial arts wisdom: mastery requires **intensive, focused study of core principles** rather than superficial exposure to many concepts.

Kajiwara's work demands repeated reading to internalize these interconnected ideas about stone power and directional strategy. Understanding deepens with each return, like meditation itself.

## Principles for Practice

### Each Stone Matters

Every stone you place:
- Carries your intention
- Expresses your character
- Cannot be taken back
- Lives in relationship to all others

### See the Whole Board

Direction is not about local tactical advantage. It is about understanding how each stone's **power radiates** across the entire position.

Think in terms of influence, not just territory. Think in terms of harmony, not just conflict.

### Accept What Is

Once a stone is played, it is permanent. There is no room for regret or second-guessing. The stone **is**—now we must play the next stone in response to this new reality.

This is Zen acceptance: not passive resignation, but active engagement with what is true now.

### The Journey Is the Destination

Do not play for rank or rating. Do not play only to win. Play to **understand**. Play to **express**. Play to **be present** with the board.

Victory and defeat are both teachers. Both are temporary. Only the practice remains.

## Reflection

Kajiwara's Direction of Play is not just a Go book—it is a philosophy of presence, responsibility, and interconnection.

Each stone we place is an act of courage: we expose ourselves, commit to a direction, and trust in the relationships we create.

This is true in Go. This is true in code. This is true in life.

The board awaits. The stone is in your hand. Where will you place it?
